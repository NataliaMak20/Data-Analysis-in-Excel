##### For my analysis I took data from the company named Contoso. Contoso selling products all over the world, online and in stores. 
##### First question is to understand how many stores Contoso have in total.

##### Let's see which type of store performs best on each continent. Physical stores in North America perform best, followed by catalog and online.
##### In Europe and Asia, relatively all types of stores perform in the same way.

##### It's good to understand what type of category of products are selling the most in each store. Here is top 3 categories from Contoso stores in Australia:
1. Home Appliances.
2. Computers.
3. Cameras and Camcorders.
##### Games and toys are the least popular among product categories.
